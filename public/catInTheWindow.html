		<p2 class = "artistBio"> About the Work :: “My art is about filling space with form, line, shape and color. The orchestration of these elements creates a visual
balancing act; much like in music, when composing and arranging notes to create a melody.
The introduction of subjective imagery in combination with abstract formal aspects, inevitably creates questions of
meaning. I’m drawn to the human story which representational art provides, and at the same time, I am drawn to the pure
feeling that nonobjective works can transmit, using only color, line, form and shape to occupy space in a meaningful way.
​ In my approach, I focus on the shape of a line, the relationship of the forms and coordination of colors. These
arrangements turn into eyes, ears, faces and bodies.  It is my intention that these arrangements work together as a dynamic
composition, to capture a moment in time that evokes the essence of profound feeling.” </p2>
